# ACM-ICPC Preparation 


This program has been developed to learn Algorithms for use in Competitive Prorgamming, **but can be used for:**
  - Competitive Programming
  - Practicing for Interviews
  - Improving Algorithmic Thinking
  - Practicing for College Classes
  - For our team right,Ayush Sharma!!


**The course requires:** 
  - To know at least one programming language well. (_You have to be able to use the language efficiently._)
  - You have to be familiar with some of the basic Data Structures (Array, Stack, Queue, etc.) (_Although if you don't know one of them, you may learn it when you come across it._)

###### _PS: I am saying "Any programming language" but in this course mostly we used C, C++ and some Java, but you can still follow the curriculum without any knowledge of these languages_

In the program there is only direction to resources, we did not add much content apart from what already existed. We just collected good sources to learn in one place, so that one can follow up and learn. The course includes algorithms and a bit data structures. You need to follow the the curriculum week by week.

**Basic following guide would be to:**
  1. See the sources to study
  2. Get the logic and try to code it without looking other code
  3. When you are stuck(you really should try first) or when you are done, look at the source code, and compare it with yours so that you can see what would be the best approach for that algorithm. You may not like others, or you may find some of them useful.
  4. After you feel comforatable with the code, try to solve the questions.
  5. When you are done with solving or are stuck(again ...) check other solutions and try to understand your mistake or to see if a better aproach exists.

## Resources

In this course we will use some tools for the questions. As I mentioned above all of these questions already exist, we just highlight them so that you can reach them easier. Here are the websites/tools that we use through this course:

  - [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com)
  - [Spoj](http://www.spoj.com)
  - [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains)
  - [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com)
  - [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com)
  - [Lightoj](http://www.lightoj.com)
  - [ACM-Timus](http://acm.timus.ru)

I gave these tools name because you may not be able to submit your solution or display the question for some websites. It would be better if you just sign up. Although it is not neccesary...

## Contribution
I and Ayush Sharma are open to any support. If you have anything to add, do not hesitate to offer!
